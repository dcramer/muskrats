Welcome Muskrats!

## About

This project is a parody, poking fun at Elon Musk's suggestion that he would permaban everyone from Twitter who was impersonating him.

![Elon's Tweet](/public/elon-is-burning-twitter-down.png?raw=true)

The project is mostly straight forward. You can only be Elon Musk - as if you're one of the many people with verified status on Twitter who are or have been acting as a parody of his account.

Your only uniqueness is a slightly randomly generated avatar (I've only pushed up a few), and an auto increment counter after your name (similar to Discord).

Some features don't work yet. Maybe they'll work soon. Maybe not.

## Develop

The project is built on Next.js 13 and Tailwind. I have no idea what I'm doing with either tech. 50/50 I've leaked a secret and someones going to charge me a lot of money. Feel free to contribute.

No this project does not use [MangoDB](https://github.com/dcramer/mangodb), but it probably should.

## Credit

Thank you...

- the Next and Vercel teams for building tech that made this (mostly) easy to ship
- the Planetscale team for letting me avoid a multi-hour GCP rabbit hole
- a bunch of folks for building their own example Twitter apps
- the Tailwind team, though I have to say I dont know how y'all deal w/ this
- (probably some others, definitely a dozen Stack Overflow contributors)
- ..and most important, Elon Musk, for providing us entertainment
